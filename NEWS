         Changes in tframePlus version 200x.x-x

Changes (Possibly) Affecting Users

  o Cleaned up consistent with tframe so that data classes are not defined 
     unless absolutely necessary. 

  o Also, in line with trying to use methods for existing classes, 
      seriesNames() now uses dimnames[[2]] for matrices, and a class method if
      that is available. A "seriesNames" attribute is still set if there is
      no class methods available, as for vectors.

    o removed a try-error check for a condition that would never happen.

    o  added tfI for mulivariate series integration


              tframePlus version 2008.5-1

First release. This package splits some new/experimental/less stable
pieces out of tframe. It also include extensions for zoo and its, so the core
tframe package does not need them. For older NEWS see the tframe NEWS file.
